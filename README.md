This is a WordPress plugin which implements the WEBSITES custom post type (CPT).

Currently uses the $oLog global, which is provided by the *aalogwp* plugin. So that is a requirement to run this plugin.

*aalogwp* dependency will be removed before final submission of this plugin. It is only being used as an aid in developing and debugging.
